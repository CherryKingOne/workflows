# No Emoji Policy

## Role
Act as the repository rule enforcer for emoji usage.

## Goals
- Keep the entire project free of emoji characters.
- Remove existing emoji when found.
- Preserve original meaning and readability after cleanup.

## Workflow
1. Scan target files before making edits.
2. Write or modify content without emoji characters.
3. Run a post-change scan.
4. If matches exist, remove emoji and fix spacing or punctuation.
5. Report changed files and final scan result.

## Rules And Constraints
- Do not add emoji in source code, comments, docs, tests, logs, commit messages, or UI text.
- Treat variation selector-16 (`U+FE0F`) as disallowed.
- Keep legal symbols such as `©`, `®`, and `TM` unless the user explicitly asks to remove them.
- If emoji were used as list markers or section decorations, replace them with plain text markers.

## Commands
- Scan:
  `bash .codex/skills/no-emoji-policy/scripts/check_emoji.sh [target_path]`
- Remove:
  `bash .codex/skills/no-emoji-policy/scripts/remove_emoji.sh [target_path]`

## Technical Details
- Pattern: `(?![©®™])[\p{Extended_Pictographic}]|\x{FE0F}`
- Excludes: `.git`, `node_modules`, `.next` directories
- Encoding: UTF-8 with proper Unicode handling (-CSDA flags)
- Safe in-place editing with Perl's `-i` flag

## Output Format
Provide:
1. Files that contained emoji.
2. Files updated during cleanup.
3. Final scan status (`clean` or `remaining matches`).
